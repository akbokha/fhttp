%	ABSTRACT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\lettrineabstract{fHTTP is an application which has been developed in relation to the lab assignment of the course Laboratory on Offensive Computer Security as taught at Eindhoven University of Technology. The incentive behind fHTTP is to develop (and release) an application capable of a fully-fledged ARP spoofing tool. The spoofing capabilities can then be used for other attacks which target both the confidentiality and integrity of the users and/or systems on the same (local) network. That is, we provide our users to filter traffic on the network and we facilitate the option to inject malicious code into traffic which is read, manipulated and passed on.}

In particular, we provide our users to read insecure cookies (which can be exploited for session-hijacking), to filter (unencrypted) traffic passing by based on self-specified regular-expressions and we provide our users the ability to inject code into the packets that pass by. The users can inject into an \texttt{img-}tag and the user can change the \text{accept-encoding} HTTP header to change (or disable) the content encoding algorithm. Lastly, \texttt{Nmap}-like functionality is incorporated into the application to provide the users the ability to scan the local network for potential targets. This is in relation to the \textit{main-objective} of this application: the application should be an easy-to-use tool usable in different scenarios and settings. We do not want to bother the users with continuous interaction with a command-line interface. The capabilities of the applications and a general idea of how to employ the application should be clear after one glance at \href{https://github.com/akbokha/fhttp}{\texttt{fHTTP}'s GitHub page}.
