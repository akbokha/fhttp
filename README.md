# fhttp <img src="/media/fhttp_logo.ico" width="50" align="left"/>
*fhttp* is an application which is capable of exploiting vulnerabilities such as ARP cache poisoning.
The (man-in-the-middle) positions that are acquired through the exploitation of these vulnerabilities are then used for things such as:
- packet-sniffing
- `theft' of (insecure) cookies

#### Project objectives
The main objective is to build an *easy-to-use* interface. 
- The users should be able to perform the aforementioned attacks without the need of a substantial understanding of the underlying vulnerabilities &rightarrow; users should only be bothered with input/selection/configurations
- The users should be able to perform the aforementioned attack withouts the need for (frequent) usage of a command-line interface &rightarrow; A GUI is built using *TkInter*
